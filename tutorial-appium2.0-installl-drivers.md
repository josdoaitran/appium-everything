Scenario:
Suppose you want to update the appium-uiautomator2-driver to its latest version.

Steps to Update:
Check the Current Version: First, you can check the current version of the driver you have installed.

```
appium driver list
```
Install/Update the Driver: You can use the appium driver install command to install or update a specific driver. For example, to update the appium-uiautomator2-driver to the latest version:

```
appium driver install uiautomator2
```

Verify the Update: After the installation is complete, you can verify the updated version.

```
appium driver list
```
Example Output:
Assuming the current version of appium-uiautomator2-driver is 1.0.0, and the latest version available is 1.1.0, the steps would look something like this:


# Check the current version of drivers installed
```
$ appium driver list

# Output:
# appium-android-driver: 4.0.0
# appium-uiautomator2-driver: 1.0.0

# Update the uiautomator2 driver
$ appium driver install uiautomator2

# Output:
# Installing driver uiautomator2@latest...

# Verify the updated version
$ appium driver list

# Output:
# appium-android-driver: 4.0.0
# appium-uiautomator2-driver: 1.1.0
```

With this approach, you have independently updated the appium-uiautomator2-driver without affecting other drivers or the Appium Server itself. This ensures a more modular and flexible way of managing your automation setup in Appium 2.0.
